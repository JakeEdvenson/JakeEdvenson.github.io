### My primary goals for my designs for F4PGA
* Create 15 working designs for F4PGA
* Have one of these designs be a fully-working RISC-V processor
* Document every significant design by adding it to the F4PGA repository

### Current Things I am working on
*Last updated on 6/2/2022*
* Comparing the vivado netlist and the reversed netlist of Regfile.v.
* Looking into why another version of regfile.v I made works properly when the one utilizing a RAM32X1D does not.
