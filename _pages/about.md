### About my Research:

F4PGA is an open-source tool being designed by Google with the end goal of being a reliable software for creating designs and uploading them onto FPGA boards. My goal in this project is to prove that the tools work correctly with a primary focus on whether or not the output of the tools match the output of it's closed-source variants. To do this, I create designs with increasing complexity to prove that each is considered equivalent. When they are not, my goal is to find out what is not working correctly with the tools. 

### About Me: 

I'm a student at BYU studying Computer Engineering. My estimated Graduation will be in June of 2023. 

I currently work with Dr. Goeders on F4PGA Verification.

I have experience in C, C++, Verilog, System Verilog, Python, and Javascript.
