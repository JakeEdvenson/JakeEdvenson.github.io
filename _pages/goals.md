### My primary goals for my designs for F4PGA
* Create 15 working designs for F4PGA
* Have one of these designs be a fully-working RISC-V processor
* Document every significant design by adding it to the F4PGA repository

### Current Things I am working on
* Updating fasm2bels with alu.v being documented as an equivalent design.
* Creating a bugs folder for my designs that are bugged.
* Narrowing down my designs with bugs to the smallest possible design.
