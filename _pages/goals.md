### My primary goals for my designs for F4PGA
* Create 15 working designs for F4PGA
* Have one of these designs be a fully-working RISC-V processor
* Document every significant design by adding it to the F4PGA repository

### Current Things I am working on
*Last updated on 5/25/2022*
* Narrowing down my designs with bugs to the smallest possible design. 
* Fix PR for fasm2bels so every commit is signed. _(Completed)_
* Create a new design that can prove equivalence.
