### My primary goals for my designs for F4PGA
* Create 15 working designs for F4PGA
* Have one of these designs be a fully-working RISC-V processor
* Document every significant design by adding it to the F4PGA repository

### Current Things I am working on
*Last updated on 5/30/2022*
* Comparing the vivado netlist and the reversed netlist of Regfile.v.
* Analyze each component used in the vivado netlist and the reversed netlist to see what makes the difference between the two designs.
