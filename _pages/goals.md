---

### My primary goals for my designs for F4PGA
* Create 15 working designs for F4PGA
* Have one of these designs be a fully-working RISC-V processor
* Document every significant design by adding it to the F4PGA repository

### Current Things I am working on
*Last updated on 5/26/2022*
* Narrowing down my designs with bugs to the smallest possible design. 
* Create a new design that can prove equivalence. 
* Study the code that makes fasm2bels work correctly.
