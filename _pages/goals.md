### My primary goals for my designs for F4PGA
* Create 15 working designs for F4PGA
* Have one of these designs be a fully-working RISC-V processor
* Document every significant design by adding it to the F4PGA repository

### Current Things I am working on
*Last updated on 6/7/2022*
* Begin performing comparisons on the two. (Created a script that generates the two files and compares them automatically.)
* Begin performing tests using icarus and/or verilator to confirm if these "unequivalent" designs are actually the same or not.
